# Canadian Securities Course (CSC®): Accelerated Study Guide

In today's highly competitive financial services landscape, employees who are committed to their personal development are the ones who excel. The Canadian Securities Course (CSC®) developed at Canadian Securities Institute, A Moody's Analytics Company, is a well known financial services credential that many employers demand.

**The CSC® is a baseline regulatory requirement to perform securities, mutual fund and alternative funds transactions.**

This site contains supporting materials for educators and students, allowing to develop more supplemental courses, certifications, quizzes, exams.

The CSC® course is heavy and contains outdated materials such as Financial Calculator technique and even formulas based on buttons found on such calculator (currently, SHARP® EL-738XT), without real explanations of how to "invent" such formulas from scratch using for example Excel, Libre, pen and paper, or just your Infinite Mind Power.

Our goal is to design alternative ways of learning and most importantly **understanding deeply the logic of the subjects (trading, investments, insurance, law)**, and to make financial literacy simpler and accessible to everyone: students, educators, interviewers, job seekers, IT professional, professional traders, investors, and just for everyone.
